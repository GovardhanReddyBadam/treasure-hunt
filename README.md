# 🔐 QR-Based Secure Treasure Hunt Web Application

An interactive, QR-code–driven treasure hunt platform built using **Python** and **Flask**, designed for events, classrooms, and competitions.  
Each QR code unlocks a **password-protected clue** (text and/or image), guiding users step-by-step toward the final destination.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **secure, multi-QR treasure hunt system** where:
- Each QR code maps to a unique route
- Access is protected using passwords and sessions
- The password for the next QR is the answer for the question diplayed in the present QR
- Clues can include riddles, questions, and images
- The application can be accessed **across different devices and networks**

It is designed as a **real-world, event-ready application**, not just a demo.

## ⚙️ How the Application Works

1. User scans a QR code  
2. QR opens a route like `/hunt/<id>`  
3. Flask displays a password page  
4. On correct password:
   - A session is created
   - User is redirected to `/clue/<id>`
5. Clue text is shown immediately  
6. Clue image (if any) is shown after a delay  
7. User proceeds to the next location

## 🔐 Security Design

- Password validation for every QR  
- Flask sessions prevent unauthorized access  
- Direct URL access is blocked without authentication  
- High QR error correction allows safe logo embedding  

---

## 🧩 QR Code Generation

- QR codes are generated in bulk (1–90)
- Each QR points to a unique URL
- 5 rotating background color themes
- Central math-themed logo embedded
- High scannability ensured

## 🌐 Public Access Using ngrok

### Why ngrok?
Local servers (`127.0.0.1`) are not accessible from other devices.  
**ngrok creates a secure public tunnel** to your local Flask app.

### Steps to use ngrok:
1. Install ngrok from https://ngrok.com  
2. Authenticate:
   ```bash: ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN
3.Run Flask:python app.py   
4.In another terminal:ngrok http 5000   
5.Use the generated public URL in QR generation
